# Fedora light install

The following steps are the way you can create your own desktop environment using Fedora

The first step is to install the minimal Fedora OS

The following things will be installed right after :
- Xorg
- ly
- qtile
- picom
- polybar
- rofi
- conky

Then we'll be ricing the whole thing

If you are satisfied with those, you can stop and add your own stuff, although I will add my personal stuff, which makes it a bit heavier, but yet not as much as a preinstalled gnome DE.

- VSCodium
- gnome-boxes
- libreoffice
