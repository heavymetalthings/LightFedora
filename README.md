# Fedora light install

The following steps are the way you can create your own desktop environment using Fedora

# Road map

The first step is to install the minimal Fedora OS

The following things will be installed right after :
- Xorg
- ly
- qtile
- picom
- polybar
- rofi
- conky

Then we'll be ricing the whole thing

If you are satisfied with those, you can stop and add your own stuff, although I will add my personal stuff, which makes it a bit heavier, but yet not as much as a preinstalled gnome DE.

- VSCodium
- gnome-boxes
- libreoffice

# Making your own DE!

## Installing stock Fedora

First, we are going to pick the ISO installer, so, go on the fedora website, and pick the server edition

Second, pick the 64 bits netinst version, hoping you have an internet connection :)

Then we can start the install.
If you are using windows, you can use either balenaetcher or rufus to burn the ISO on a USB key.

Once you boot in the ISO, you should come to this page :
